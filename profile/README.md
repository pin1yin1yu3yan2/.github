# Pin1Yin1Yu3Yan2

A programming language organization with **Chinese Phonetic Alphabet**.

## About Pin1Yin1

### **Chinese Phonetic Alphabet** based programming language. 

We are trying to make a simple programming language for Chinese, though it is start from a toy programming language idea. We believe Pinyin would be most simple for Chinese. By using Pinyin, this language can be a true CN language developed by Chinese, using Chinese words (in some how, Pinyin is a part of Chinese) and high technical (isn't a programming language high technique).

### Advantages

- **Fast**: By using LLVM, Pin1Yin1 can be run on the real mechine. It would be as fast as C++ and Rust do.
- **Cross-platfrom**: Pin1Yin1 allows to compile into binary or LLVM bitcode. Executor can run the same source code or release bitcode on different plactforms.
- **High Memeory Safety**: We have considered a safe memory model for Pin1Yin1 language
- **Easy to Start**: For Chinese studied Pinyin which it is an *Compulsory Subjects* in primary school, without remembering any English word, can easily start with this language.
- **Defence Language**: There are many ways that you can decrease the readability of Pin1Yin1 code.
- **Highly Customization**: You can change the key words and add limits on the original language.
